## Stack Used

### Application
-------

1. **Node.js** (personally use v14.8.0) with **NPM** (I use v6.14.7) as package manager
2. **PostgreSQL** (personally use v12.1)

### Library
-------

#### Main Dependency
-------

1. **axios** (v0.27.2)
2. **body-parser** (v1.20.0)
3. **dotenv** (v16.0.1)
4. **express** (v4.18.1)
5. **pg** (v8.7.3)

#### Development Dependency
-------

Used for testing, linting, and hot-restarting server / app.

1. **chai** (v4.3.6)
2. **eslint** (v8.9.0)
3. **nodemon** (v2.0.15)
4. **supertest** (v6.2.4)

## How to Setup
-------

1. Install required applications that listed above.
2. Prepare the database (and account) to be used.
3. Setup for the messaging bot in Facebook, you can use [this](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/quick-start/) for reference.
4. Create `.env` file in the root directory of the project. And fill the file with these contents (or just copy from `.env.example` file).
   ```
   SERVER_PORT=<>

   PGHOST=<>
   PGPORT=<>
   PGUSER=<>
   PGPASSWORD=<>
   PGDATABASE=<>

   PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<>
   VERIFY_TOKEN=<>
   ```
   change these `<>` values with desired unused and valid port number, DB and FB (`PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` & `VERIFY_TOKEN`) creds that you already created.
5. Install libraries for the project using `npm install`.
6. Migrate DB schema using `npm run reset-postgres` or `migrate-up-postgres`.
7. Run app opr server using `npm start` for development or `npm run start-prod` for production.
9. For exposing to the FB, you can use various ways, such as deploying the server or use `ngrok`.
10. Set the webhook URL in FB page, for more detail, look at the reference on step number 3.

The application / server should be ready to use.

## Model Data Used
-------

Because it's in Javascript, actually data structures in the program is schemaless (just using JS object). However, based on the data representation on database, here are the data structures that being used.

1. **users**
   ```
   psid BIGINT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
   name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY(psid)
   ```
2. **messages**
   ```
   id serial PRIMARY KEY,
   user_psid BIGINT NOT NULL,
   message_text TEXT NOT NULL,
   created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   FOREIGN KEY (user_psid) REFERENCES users(psid) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
   ```

And this is the visualization of model using ERD.

![Model-ERD](docs/model-erd.png))

So, `users` has one-to-many relationship with `messages`.

## Tests
-------

So far, the integration tests has been implemented for the API.

## What can be Improved / Implemented Next
-------

- [X] Centralized log
- [ ] More bot interaction
- [ ] More intelligent bot to recognize chat pattern, maybe using NLP
